# The impact of Covid-19 on Movie Theater Operations

## Research Question

The outbreak of covid has limited some public activities, and the use of indoor public space such as movie theaters has been restricted. At the same time, the development of streaming media begins to provide people with new movie watching options.

In this research, I want to explore whether there is a correlation between covid and the change of cinema numbers by means of data and geographical analysis.And further analyze whether this change has driven a shift in the way people watch movies from traditional cinemas to streaming media.

## Methodology

### Data Analysis

**Geographical Range: United States**

**Time Range: 2019-2022****

For data analysis, the author will use some country level data from 2019 to 2022. By observing the number of new and closed cinemas before and after the covid, we can see the impact of covid on the number of cinemas.

### Geographical Analysis

**Geographical Range: From United States to Bay Area Counties**

**Time Range: 2020-2022**

For geographical analysis, the author will use both country and county level data. By comparing the locations of new and closed cinemas after covid with the severity level of covid, it is possible to analyze whether there is a correlation between them.
